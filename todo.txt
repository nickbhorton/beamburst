1. Expand usability of material class so that blin-phong, and other coefficient 
are not hardcoded.
2. Work on textures so that reflection and refraction can be tested properly.
3. Alter interface so that an entire u direction, v direction, surface normal 
coordinate system can be constructed for each type of object. Normal mapping 
works perfectly if the corrdinate system lines up with the xyz corrdinate 
system however on an object like a sphere the surface normal is the new z 
direction and the uv gives a position on the sphere surface from which the x and 
y directions can be calculated. After decoding the texture normal from tangent 
space it has to be converted to the local corrdinate system of the surface. This 
has not been an issue to this point yet but the intersectable interface needs to 
be able to give a local corrdinate space based on the surface normal. May 29th
